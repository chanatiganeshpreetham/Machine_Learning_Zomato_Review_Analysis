# Machine_Learning_Zomato_Review_Analysis
Zomato_Review_Analysis

Aim:
In this project, we aim to build a machine learning model that can automatically predict the sentiment of a Zomato review as positive or negative.

Project Overview:
The project will involve the following steps:

1. Data Collection: Collect a dataset of Zomato restaurant reviews that includes text reviews and their corresponding ratings.

2. Data Cleaning: Remove any irrelevant information from the dataset, such as usernames, dates, or locations. Then, perform text preprocessing techniques such as lowercasing, stopword removal, stemming or lemmatization, and punctuation removal.

3. Feature Extraction: Convert the preprocessed text reviews into numerical vectors using techniques like bag-of-words, TF-IDF, or word embeddings.

4. Label Generation: Assign a binary sentiment label to each review based on its rating, where 1 represents a positive sentiment and 0 represents a negative sentiment 

5. Model Training: Split the dataset into training and testing sets, and use machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes, to train a classification model that predicts the sentiment of the review based on the extracted features.

6. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance on the testing set by finding accuracy.

Conclusion:
The Zomato Review Analysis using Machine Learning project is an exciting opportunity to apply machine learning techniques to solve a real-world problem. By predicting the sentiment of Zomato reviews, we can help users make informed decisions when choosing a restaurant and help restaurant owners understand their customers' feedback better.
